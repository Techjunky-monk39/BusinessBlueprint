# Application Review Observations

## Missing Features

- [ ] **Feature 1**: Placeholder code found in `src/components/UserProfile.tsx` at line 45. The `loadUserDetails` function is not implemented.
- [ ] **Feature 2**: `TODO` comment in `src/services/apiService.js` at line 78 indicates the need for error handling in the `fetchData` function.
- [ ] **Feature 3**: Incomplete UI for the settings page in `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`. The form lacks validation logic.
- [ ] **Feature 4**: Missing unit tests for `src/utils/formatDate.js`. No coverage for edge cases.
- [ ] **Feature 5**: Search functionality is not implemented in `src/pages/SearchPage.tsx`. Placeholder input field exists without logic.

## Specific Issues

- [x] **Issue 1**: Runtime error when navigating to the dashboard. Error message: `Cannot read property 'data' of undefined` in `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` at line 32.
- [x] **Issue 2**: Failing test case in `tests/UserProfile.test.js`. Test `should render user details correctly` fails due to missing mock data.
- [ ] **Issue 3**: API call timeout when fetching large datasets in `src/services/apiService.js`. Investigate performance optimization.
- [ ] **Issue 4**: Styling inconsistency in `src/components/Header.tsx`. The header does not align properly on mobile devices.
- [x] **Issue 5**: Memory leak warning in `src/hooks/useFetchData.js` when navigating away before the fetch completes.
